			<h2> A Little Bit About Me </h2>

			<p> I grew up in Hillsboro, Missouri, on the outskirts of Saint Louis. I had a very peaceful childhood, surrounded by woods and a few neighbors that I used to explore the woods and play things like soccer with. When I was 8 years old I was shown an MMORPG by my brother called Tibia which sparked my love for gaming, I actually still dabble with tibia every once in a while. Since then I have put in thousands of hours on different games, from Tibia to Elder Scrolls v: Skyrim to World of Warcraft to Factorio. Funny enough I didn't actually start my college career going for a computer science degree, instead I spent a year and a half at Saint Louis University (SLU) going for a degree in Clinical Laboratory Science while also being PreMed. During my 3rd semester at SLU I figured out that the medical field was not actually where I wanted to end up in the end. Once I figured that out it did not take long for me to figure out that working with computers was where I wanted to end up, specifically working on making the games that I love so much. I believe it took 1 month between deciding I wanted to change schools/majors and actually getting accepted into Missouri University of Science and Technology (Missouri S&T) computer science program. After 4 more years at Missouri S&T I managed to graduate with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science which brings me to the present and my job search. </p>
